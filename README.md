### Dia dhuit! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maeve/MÃ©aá¸‹á¸ƒ, a research software engineer on the research computing team at the University of Leeds.

Have you come looking for presentation slides? You can find them [here](https://murphyqm.github.io/slides/).

- ðŸ”­ I have a PhD in planetary science, where I modelled early-Solar System planetesimals using Python, and tied these models to geochemical and microstructural analyses of meteorites. See some of my publications/research outputs here:
  - [Interactive planetary science: explore pallasite cooling](https://pallasite.streamlit.app/)
  - [The Conductive Cooling of Planetesimals With Temperature-Dependent Properties (Murphy Quinlan et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JE006726)
  - [Reconciling fast and slow cooling during planetary formation as recorded in the main group pallasites (Murphy Quinlan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2023.118284)
  - [Pytesimal: A **Py**thon package to model plane**tesimals** (Murphy Quinlan and Walker, 2020)](https://murphyqm.github.io/pytesimal/)
  - [PytesiMINT: **Pytesi**mal **M**etal **INT**rusion model (Murphy Quinlan, 2023)](https://github.com/murphyqm/pytesimint)


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about containerisation using both Docker and Apptainer to support researchers in reproducible computation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m collaborating on a number of projects supporting webapps developed both with Python/Dash and R/RShiny, deployed with Azure: [Priority Places for Food Index](https://priorityplaces.cdrc.ac.uk/); [Nutrient Profile Model Calculator](https://npmcalculator.cdrc.ac.uk/); [nutrientprofiler R package](https://murphyqm.github.io/edits-nutrientprofiler/).

# âš¡Avoid DeReLiCT Code

Read more [here](https://derelict.streamlit.app/).

1. **De**penedencies: record your dependencies, use a package manager to pin them, avoid dependency hell!
2. **Re**pository: put your code in a publically accessible, version-controlled repository.
3. **Li**cense: add a license to your software.
4. **C**itation: make it easy for users to cite your code with a Citation Format File (CFF).
5. **T**esting: test your code and benchmarking, the same way you would validate laboratory analyses.

# Package your Python Code

Quickly generate a minimalist, simple project folder structure and a `pyproject.toml` file for your Python package [here](https://package-your-python.streamlit.app/).
