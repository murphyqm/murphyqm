### Dia dhuit! 👋

I'm Maeve/Méaḋḃ, a research software engineer on the research computing team at the University of Leeds.

- 🔭 I have a PhD in planetary science, where I modelled early-Solar System planetesimals using Python, and tied these models to geochemical and microstructural analyses of meteorites. See some of my publications/research outputs here:
  - [Interactive planetary science: explore pallasite cooling](https://pallasite.streamlit.app/)
  - [The Conductive Cooling of Planetesimals With Temperature-Dependent Properties (Murphy Quinlan et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JE006726)
  - [Reconciling fast and slow cooling during planetary formation as recorded in the main group pallasites (Murphy Quinlan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2023.118284)
  - [Pytesimal: A **Py**thon package to model plane**tesimals** (Murphy Quinlan and Walker, 2020)](https://murphyqm.github.io/pytesimal/)
  - [PytesiMINT: **Pytesi**mal **M**etal **INT**rusion model (Murphy Quinlan, 2023)](https://github.com/murphyqm/pytesimint)


- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about containerisation using both Docker and Apptainer to support researchers in reproducible computation.
- 👯 I’m collaborating on a number of projects supporting webapps developed both with Python/Dash and R/RShiny, deployed with Azure.
